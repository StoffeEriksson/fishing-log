### Code validation <a name="code-validation"></a>

#### CSS validation <a name="css-validation"></a>

My CSS code passed validation with no errors

![CSS validation](/climbing_log/static/images/css_validation.jpg)

#### HTML validation <a name="html-validation"></a>

My HTML code has a number of errors as seen below, these were due to a number of trailing slashes, br elements being used in lists and an unclosed div.

I rectified all these issues and my code passed as can be seen below
